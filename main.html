<b>About this Layout--></b><br>
Yes, a grayscaled layout!  ^_^  This frames layout features Chii from Chobits.  I couldn't really 
think of a title for this layout, so it's just untitled.  ^^;;  I also added in an abstract art that 
I made--which is basically the background and around Chii.  ^_~  Many thanks goes to the 
<a href="http://animeshrine.com" target="_blank"><b>Anime Shrine</b></a> for the original image of 
Chii.     
<p>
<b>How to Use It--></b><br>
<i>index.html</i> is basically your main/home page--it has all the frames coding; so don't really 
tamper with it unless you're changing the page's title.  ^_~  <i>blank.html</i> is, as it is titled, a 
blank page for the solid and empty parts about this frames layout.  All images contained within the 
.zip file are important as well--so don't delete any of them.  <i>main.html</i> is for your main 
section--where all your contents that aren't a part of the menu go.  ^_~  So edit that file and 
replace all the contents in the div layer with your own stuff.  <i>menu.html</i> is where your 
menu section is in--again, replace the contents there (EXCEPT the "Credits" part) with your own menu.  
And if you don't happen to like some of the colors or font that I chose for this layout, you can 
go to <i>chii_style.css</i> for that.  
<p>
<b>Credits--></b><br>
Like I had mentioned earlier, in the menu section, you will see a "Credits" with two links below it.  
I would really appreciate it if you do NOT remove both links.  Credit goes to <a 
href="http://animeshrine.com" target="_blank">Anime Shrine</a> for the original image of Chii, while 
credit goes to me (at <a href="http://lovelyd.shukuya.com/" target="_blank">Lovely Designs</a>), for 
creating the layout, as well as the abstract art.  Please do not claim this layout as your own.  If 
you do not like our links to be there, then you can make a separate Credits page and give 
credit to both sites there.  If you have any other concerns, please contact me at this email:
